Recently I found a very useful thing. This is a [roadmap](https://github.com/skydoves/android-developer-roadmap) Android development. This roadmap, as you can already guess, contains all the main topics of the Android ecosystem that the developer needs.
Despite its stable reputation, the repository is open to edits and suggestions, which only increases the relevance of the entire tree.

I would also advise you to view the [review](https://youtu.be/L41s_iVzGrU) (RU lang, lol) one developer per this map. He gives an idea of what is happening on the ‚Äúbattlefield‚Äù in general, and in addition cuts off branches that are unnecessary to someone.

***Remark.*** *This is created just to roughly navigate your learning path. Branches can (often need to) be passed asynchronously, inconsistently. Flair works better here..*
