## First month: First impression of Android development

![First month](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81878781/180449126-fadec16d-629f-402e-89ae-32f9472cc4ad.png)

I've been studying Android development for a month now (subtracting omissions due to study and just procrastination, lol), and now I'll tell you what I realized.

Firstly, the community is very lively. Documentation, lessons, courses, libraries, tools - there are a lot of them, and, most importantly, they are all of high quality. Android Platform Documentation (https://developer.android.com/docs ) and the Kotlin language (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html ) - it's just gorgeous, a detective novel (okay, I went overboard here). By the way the Flutter docks (https://docs.flutter.dev /) also cool, you can take a look. Well, maybe this is not surprising, because everything I mentioned is a division of Google, which is not allowed and simply unprofitable to do dirt.

Secondly, the architecture of the Android platform seems intuitive to me, and it's cool (at least if you don't switch to a very low-level development). It can be seen that work is underway on the comfort of development. Resource directories, the life cycle of activity, the interaction between components - all this has clear schemes and principles.

In general, the whole atmosphere in terms of training is quite friendly.

If we talk separately about the Kotlin language, I really like it. Of course, it would be possible to paint about some bitwise operations, solving the problem of closed inheritance and other things. Honestly: I'm lazy and I'm a little stupid. But I can say that this language combines the advantages of C-like languages and elegance (https://developer.android.com/images/kotlin/code-samples/code-sample-small.svg ). I think Kotlin is enough for both the client and server components in full. And in general, have you seen the Kotlin logo? it's just crazy (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-logo.html )..

Summing up, I can say that Android development is a buzz. It is interesting, moderately difficult and comfortable.
