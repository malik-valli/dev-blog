## "Digital Nomads": Digital nomadism as the meaning of working in IT

Sooner or later, the question appears in your head: “why am I going to IT?”. It can be answered in different ways: money; prestige; love of development; and more.
If we discard thoughts about material privileges and leave the items “for the soul”, the number of enthusiasts decreases. And that's fine.

But in addition to all the features of work in this area, there is a fundamental one – the possibility of remote work, in the best sense of this form of employment.
I don't know about you, but it really charges me. Just imagine: you can easily break into Prague at any time, spend a week in kavarnja, and after a while get lost in the local Oslo park. Arrange a political altercation with a Romanian, barely understanding his arguments, or suddenly find yourself half-Jewish, buying tickets to Jerusalem.

Does it sound infantile? all right.
But for some it may be a sufficient meaning of life.

Just thoughts.
