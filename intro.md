Hi! My name is **Malik**, I am 18 years old, and now I am a **novice Android developer**.

With this post I open my developer blog called Singular. This blog will be mainly devoted to mobile, specifically Android development (in the future, maybe cross-platform development). This is done in order not to be sprayed too much, and in order for the blog to be more predictable for the reader. But, of course, if you look not from a technical point of view, the very word “blog” suggests that I will tell my story. So everything will, of course, be seasoned with “soft content". And, in fact, this blog will be of great benefit to beginners in development or other interested people.

Since I started talking about history, it should be counted from something. Let's move on to a brief retelling of my “developer's path”, reaching today. I warn you in advance about my bad memory, especially the memory of childhood :)

I got acquainted with programming in 2018, when I was 14 years old. Autumn, school days. Then I could spend all day playing mobile games (which really didn't care about my health). Despite the dubiousness of this lesson, it was it that pushed me to develop: I dreamed of creating my own game. Starting to dig into this topic, I discovered the Unity game engine, and later the C# language. Realizing that I needed some kind of push, I signed up for a C# programming circle, which I attended from the fall of 2018 to the summer of 2019. It is impossible to say that this gave me great knowledge. Perhaps this is my fault, and perhaps this is the fault of the fact that we were very fixated on only one language, in the dry. Despite this, I was successfully poking around in Unity and even creating something.

Then I did not attend any clubs. I sat at home and dug into game development alone. I must say that it was just a terrible development strategy. It is not only very difficult to cook alone in all this, but it also puts a lot of pressure on the psyche.

Those years were unproductive. I could have given up on development for a couple of months. There was no system of my training from the word at all. Basically, I was fixated on just one game scene. I have a lot of bad feelings associated with this period, so I don't like to remember it: it doesn't make sense to discuss it here :)

Next, I have already tried to build the structure of my development as a developer. Of course, it wasn't particularly effective, but at least it was something. I took a course at Coursera on Unity, prepared for exams in mathematics and, God forbid, computer science. By the way, speaking of mathematics, it was just a huge leap for me in it for 4 months of studying this subject (was zero). And speaking of development, I created several small games on Unity.

At the same time, I got acquainted with Flutter and Dart (cross-platform application development). This acquaintance was limited mainly to the development of only one large application. It was too big, so after a couple of months I abandoned this case, even though I liked this area.

There were periods of both development and inactivity. Such a chaotic schedule, obviously, did not bring much progress. We can say that for the period of the end of 2018 - 2020, two years and four months, I was engaged in time development for a total of about a year, subtracting all periods of downtime. And the beginning of 2021 was quite productive (the first full-fledged game projects).

In 2021, I passed the exams and successfully entered the Moscow University in the direction of “applied informatics”. Moving to a large city, active socialization and living in a hostel had a great impact on me. Positive influence. It really was a good step: to come out of your “shell”.

But everything was not so rosy. I felt like I was just burned out: I'm just sick of programming. If you delve into psychological problems, I was gnawing at myself for the “mediocre time spent” in recent years, and for the fact that, having buried myself in programming, I lost socialization, health, etc. But it's probably not about programming. If you remember that I was not doing anything very intensively at that time, and that doing programming does not mean not doing health and not communicating with people (in other words, programming has nothing to do with it), then these pens are slowly evaporating by themselves.

But then (and even now not to the end) I could not build it in my head. And finally, all those thoughts brought me to the point that I was just mired in a severe depression. This is probably one of the darkest times in my life. I was just sickened by the mere mention of programming. I'm lost.

Okay, let's not go too deep. But if you feel that you are in such a situation: a psychotherapist.

And now we are getting closer to today.

When I came to my senses (the beginning of February 2022), and when programming began to arouse some interest again, I made a promise to myself that I would clearly choose the field of development and would not jump anywhere or do irrational actions, suffer from perfectionism or some other destructive bullshit. I have a baggage of knowledge for, in total, a year and a half of training from scratch, and with this baggage I am steadfastly moving on, trying not to look back at the past.

I must say that at that time I already had a little experience in developing mobile applications on Flutter. This greatly boosted my knowledge in development in general, and in general, then I had good impressions of mobile development.

Set a course! Set sail! In a couple of weeks, I decided on the direction - Android development and the Kotlin language. In March I started my training.

Why not Flutter, which was previously mentioned? It is used to develop cross-platform applications (for iOS, Android, Web and Windows). But this format is not really good for beginners in this field. It is often advised to start with one thing, native: iOS or Android, in order to get a feel for the very concept of mobile development. But, as I noticed at the very beginning of the post, I'm thinking about switching to cross-platform development in the future. And, in fact, Flutter is very good at integrating all native features.

That's probably the whole story! Such a bumpy path. So many mistakes. But how many mistakes, so many lessons.

The main problem was that I was alone: without a mentor, without a community. Such a set of “Do it yourself!”, which I would now sign in a different way: “Burn out even faster!”

To be honest, I wouldn't say that I've fixed this problem now, but I'm trying.. honestly :)

And this blog is another opportunity to join the community, to find a response from other people.
